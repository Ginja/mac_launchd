# Parameters:
#	ensure      - Value must be present or absent. Used for placing files.
#	label		    - Label key inside the launchd plist. Needed for loading and unloading.
# type        - Value must be 'LaunchAgents' or 'LaunchDaemons'. Used for determing where to place launchd job.
#	launchdf 	  - Value must be the name of the launchd plist. File needs to be stored in this module's files/$fdir directory.
# load        - Value must be true or false (no quotes). Used for determining whether or not to load or unload a launchd job.
# fdir        - Value must be the same as one of the folders in the files directory of this module. Needed for organizational purposes.
#	script      - Default value is ''. Any other value must be a script located in the $fdir directory. Specify only if your launchd job calls a script
#	script_path	- Path where you want to store your script on the client side. Make sure your launchd job plist calls the script from this location.
#	owner	 	    - Default value is 'root'. Any other value must be a valid user. Used for setting the script's owner.
#	group    	  - Default value is 'wheel'. Any other value must be a valid group. Used for setting the script's group.
#	mode     	  - Default value is '0644'.
#
# Example:
#  Loading a job with a script:
#      mac_launchd { 'somejob-load':
#        ensure      => 'present',
#        label       => 'ca.someplace.somedept.somejob',
#        type        => 'LaunchAgents',
#        launchdf    => 'ca.someplace.somedept.somejob.plist',
#        load        => true,
#        script      => 'somejob.scpt',
#        script_path => '/Library/Scripts/launchd_scripts',
#        fdir        => 'SomeDept',
#      }
#  Unloading a job with a script:
#      mac_launchd { 'somejob-unload':
#        ensure      => 'absent',
#        label       => 'ca.someplace.somedept.somejob',
#        type        => 'LaunchAgents',
#        launchdf    => 'ca.someplace.somedept.somejob.plist',
#        load        => false,
#        script      => 'somejob.scpt',
#        script_path => '/Library/Scripts/launchd_scripts',
#        fdir        => 'SomeDept',
#      }
#
# Caveats:
#  For now, unloading a job that has a script does not remove that script.
#  If you are unloading a job with a script ensure you still specify a script_path, otherwise you'll have errors in your puppet runs.
